# RockClimbs App :muscle:
## A website as part of the Web Services and Applications course

This github repository helps you set your own database of climbs as well as deploying it in a web interface where you can perform crud operations. 

Currently the App allows to view your current climbs, add new climbs and also view the crags added in the database. 

## Repository structure
The repository contains the following folder and files: 

- **Templates folder**: the templates folder contains the .html files that are displayed in the web. 
- **climbDao.py**:
- **dbconfig.py**:
- **server.py**: 
- **rockclimbs.sql**: this sql file helps you set the database of your climbs locally, so you can use the remaining of the scripts within this repository to test the App and continue modifying it. Simply copy it , include your climbs, crags or any other information you might want to store and create the table locally using MySQL.
